# StevenA's fork of st - the suckless terminal

The [suckless terminal (st)](http://st.suckless.org) with patches and tweaks applied

The following patches were applied:
+ Scrollback - allowes scrolling back in the st history using Shift-PgUp/PgDn
+ Scrollback with mousewheel - allows scrolling with Shift-mousewheel
+ Scrollback with mousewheel2 - allows scrolling with just the mousewheel if we are not already in a scrollable window.
+ 10k lines of scrollback - the scrollback patch was modified to allow 10k instead of 2k of line scrolling.
